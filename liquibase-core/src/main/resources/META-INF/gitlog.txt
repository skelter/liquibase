bb8e347 Exchange class-level PrepareForTest annotation for method-level with more specific classes to speed up tests. I moved this annotation from the class @PrepareForTest({SqlGeneratorFactory.class, CheckSum.class}) and used more specific annotations on individual test methods because SqlGeneratorFactory was scanning classes and interacting with large numbers of mocked/generated classes with proxied methods.  The behavior seemed to differ between Linux and Windows. I don't really know why yet.

bdb56c0 CORE-1219. Removed empty DatabaseException catch blocks around database.rollback() calls in the LockService, which were believed to hide the real cause of the problem described in the incident. Initially, it was thought that no databse.rollback() was being called, thus leaving the Oracle lock hanging. However, the code inspection revealed that database.rollback() must have been called (as it was alreay in the finally block); however, it must have failed for some reason, and this reason was not reported due to empty DatabaseException catch blocks.

c748abd It helps if I actually run tests, because then I find problems like stale references to the old name of the XSD.
ba54a9a Per nvoxland's feedback on https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2, I've renamed the XSD to go with the next minor release (2.1) instead of the next point release (2.0.2).
6f193f7 Include at least one test case for the namespaced-attributes-are-meaningless-to-liquibase feature. This test duplicates simpleChangeLogTest, except that (a) the schema used is the 2.0.2 schema and (b) it contains some meaningless attributes.
7b844ba Allow namespaced attributes on the following elements:  - <databaseChangeLog> - semantically, applying to this whole changelog.  - <include> - semantically, applying to the whole included changelog.  - <includeAll> - as with <include>  - <changeSet> - semantically, applying only to that change set.

7b4492e Fix for bug where, if you were using migrateSQL and the database did not already contain the liquibase tables, then there would be two create calls for the changelog and lock tables. The AbstractDatabase class now has a flag to remember whether it already issued the "CREATE TABLE" commands.
